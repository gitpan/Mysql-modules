To install the package you usually just type

    perl Makefile.PL
    make               # optional
    make test          # optional
    make install

During the first step you will be asked the question in which
directory the API library and headerfile is installed. You can avoid
this question by setting the MSQL_HOME environment variable.  If the
file $MSQL_HOME/include/msql.h exists, you will not be prompted for
the installation directory.

Please let me know, if you have further questions that should be dealt
with in this document.

Enjoy,
andreas
