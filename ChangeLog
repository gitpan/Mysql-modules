DBD::mysql for DBI - Written by Jochen Wiedmann <wiedmann@neckar-alb.de>

97.09.27 V1.1812
          Added t/50commit.t to test suite.
	  Included <embed.h> in myMsql.h for redefining my_setenv().
	  Made AutoCommit, Commit and Rollback DBI conformant.
	  Fixed reconnect problems with Mysql: mysql_port was 0 on some
	  systems.
	  Added support of mysql_real_connect to myMsql.c.
	  Fixed Msql::errno returning a char*.
	  Added lib/Bundle::Mysql.pm.
          Fixed 'use Mysql' to 'require Mysql' in t/mysql2.t.
	
97.09.12 V1.1810
	  Fixed bug in dbd_st_FETCH_internal: newRV_noinc was used for
	  the return value. This resulted in invalid cache values,
	  reported by Michael Bletzinger
	  <Michael.Bletzinger@ssa.crane.navy.mil>

97.09.12 V1.1809
	  Adapted changes from DBD-Oracle 0.46 to 0.47; in particular
	  the files Driver.xst and dbd_xsh.h from the DBI distribution
	  are used now. (LongReadLen, LongTruncOk, ... are still
	  meaningless, but they are not that important for m(y)sql:
	  The complete results are in RAM anyways ...)
          Fixed man page of DBD::M(y)SQL: "@names = $sth->{'NAME'}".
	  Added parameter completion for "set" command to dbimon.
	
97.09.08  V1.1808
	  Fixed bug in dbimon, a closing brace was missing causing a
	  syntax error.
	  Fixed problems in the Term::ReadLine::GNU support, reported
	  by Nem W. Schlecht (nem@abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu).
	  Modified dbimon for internally using the Data::ShowTable
	  module. My thanks to Tim Bunce for the hint.
	  Compatibility fixes for SunOS and Solaris, supplied by
	  Neil Bowers (neilb@cre.canon.co.uk).
	
97.09.03  V1.1806
          Fixed bug in Mysql.xs: $sth->numfields dumped core because no
	  check for a result was done.
	  Fixed bug in lib/Mysql/Statement.pm: Mysql::Statement.as_string
	  did not check for $sth->numfields != 0.
	  Added patch from Nem W. Schlecht (nem@abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu)
	  for Term::ReadLine::GNU support to pmysql and dbimon.
	
97.09.03  V1.1805
	  Fixed bug in DBD::mysql: Executing a non-select statement
	  always returned -1 (unknown number of rows) although the
	  correct number was returned by $sth->rows().
	  Fixed bug in DBD::mysql: strlen was executed on a NULL
	  value when mysql_fetch_rows returned a NULL field.
	  Added all _ListField attributes to statement handles.
	  Added support for "LISTFIELDS <table>" to $sth->execute.
	  Modified $sth->func("_ListSelectedFields") and
	  $dbh->func("<table>", "_ListFields") to use the new
	  possibilities; in fact these are only stubs now.
	  Added dbimon.
	  Added some internal attributes for dbimon to DBD::mysql:
	  format_default_size, format_max_size, format_type_name
	  and format_right_justification.
	
97.08.30  V1.1804
	  Added "fancy", "quote", "separator" and "escape" commands to
	  pm(y)sql.PL, patch supplied by Nem W Schlecht
	  (nem@abattoir.cc.ndsu.nodak.edu).
	  Modified pm(y)sql.PL and pmsql.PL so that it automatically
	  adapts pm(y)sql for use with Msql and Mysql, respectively.
	  Makefile.PL and M(y)sqlPerl/Makefile.PL now automatically
	  adapt lib/M(y)sql.pm, lib/M(y)sql/Statement.pm and
	  lib/DBD/mSQL.pm or lib/DBD/mysql.pm for use in Msql-modules
	  or Mysql-modules; just copy these files, rename them and
	  run "perl Makefile.PL".
	
97.08.29  V1.1803
	  Added mysql_errno()
	  Modified perl modules for use of $driver and isa($driver).
	  Modified Msql.xs and Mysql.xs for use of Package and
	  StPackage.
	  Modified test for fetch of non-result sth in akmisc.t: Msql
	  returns number of rows and not an sth.
	
97.08.27  Removed use of TEXT_TYPE from pmysql and Mysql/Statement.pm.

97.08.16  Modified mysql.xs, dbdimp.h and dbdimp.c for use in DBD::mSQL.
	  Now using Andreas König´s Makefile.PL from the DBD::mSQL
	  distribution.
	  Added check for disabled '-lgcc' on Linux; this leads to a
	  missing __moddi3 symbol in libmysqlclient.a, when running
	  mysql.so.

	  Added mysqlperl support.
	
97.08.02  Almost completely rewritten, with the exception of private
          functions like _ListTables.
          Implemented bind_param.
          Test suite rewritten for portability.
          Many sources moved from mysql.pm and mysql.xs to dbdimp.h;
          mysql.pm and mysql.xs are now close to Oracle.xs and Oracle.pm.

97.07.28  Added $dbh->quote method.
	  Modified internal use of "char* statement" to "SV* statement".
	  Modified use of mysql_query to mysql_real_query. (The above
	  three things should fix blob problems hopefully.)
	  Bumped revision number to 2.00 because of API changes:
	  The connect method works now as described in the DBI man
	  page, compatibility to DBD::msql seems deprecated.
	  Heavy internal modifications in order to use DBIS->get_fbav();
	  this gives compatibility to DBI 0.88.
	  Modified test suite to use Test::Harness.
	  Added blob tests.

Original ChangeLog:

18/07/95:	Started. 

		Version 0.0.0 ( Totally pre-alpha! )

19/07/95:22:00	Code now basically seems to work. I've got connection to
		a database, and clean disconnection.

	 23:45	I'm now working on the statement cycle stuff, which I've
		mapped out. It's just a case of coding, which shouldn't
		take too long, hopefully.

		Posted notice of approaching doom to perldb-interest.

20/07/95:01:25	Fetching appears to work OK now. I need to read the API on
		msqlFieldSeek, since I can't work out why fetch is returning
		the same row over and over! 

21/07/95:09:22  Added a field into imp_sth (currow) which keeps track of the
                current row that's been fetched from the result struct. If I
                can fix the return codes coming from fetchrow, it'll work!

21/07/95:10:30  Pondered bind variables in cursors. Since there isn't a bind
                function in the API, I may have to frig the way that prepare/
                execute works, ie, move the call to msqlQuery *after* it's
                done some parsing for bind values......Hm.

21/07/95:10:35  Twiddled some bits in the fetchrow cycle. 

23/07/95:15:50  Fetch is fetching a row, but it's not returning it to the 
        	calling cycle, so I need to fart about with the sv stuff, which
		is not amusing me greatly!

26/07/95:23:42	Decided in agreement with Andreas that the first release is
		to be 0.61! 

27/07/95:14:14	Finally! It fucking works! After splendid quantities of
      		hacking around with the prepare/execute/fetchrow/finish cycle
		it's actually returning rows correctly!

		NOTE: The SV handling within dbd_describe is shot to buggery,
		      but I've kludged it in mSQL.xs::fetchrow to do a
		      sv_2mortal instead of a sv_mortalcopy.

27/07/95:14:22	Tidied up mSQL.xs::finish to do an msqlFreeResult. Annoyingly
		enough, there's no return code to msqlFR, so I can't test 
		whether or not it's worked! Bah!

27/07/95:15:15	Altered test to do several bits and bobs. I'm testing INSERT
		statements now. These only execute an msqlQuery, but the
		stuff needs to continue to pass through the execute and finish
		stages cleanly.......*sigh*

27/07/95:15:22	My dubious 'INSERT' check hack works, sort of. Pity it converts
		the entire statement to lower case.....! 

27/07/95:17:33	Twiddled some more stuff so it seems to do CREATE TABLE,
		INSERT statements too. Of course, there's no error checking
		yet, but it seems to be OK........Hm.

27/07/95:17:38	Mailed out a statement saying the 0.61 code would be up for
		grabs as of Monday 31st July! Still waiting on Alpha reports.

27/07/95:12:11	Fixed the lower-case all the INSERT/CREATE &c. statement bug.
		It now checks to see if you're in quotes.

28/07/95:xx:xx	Got a report back from Andreas to say  compilation barfs on
		his Indy. Fixed a load of do_error bugs in dbdimp.c. 

13/08/95:18:25  Finally got back to this after a rather long break. Fixed some
		Makefile.PL bugs that were kicking about. Finally fixed
		( or appeared to fix ) the strlen signedness bug in dbdimp.c
		that may halt compilation on the Indy. 

		Emailed Karsten the debug info to see what's causing problems
		on the NeXTStep platform.

14/08/95:13:48	Got email back from Andreas. signedness broke mSQL.xs as well!
		Fixed that and emailed him a quick patch.

14/08/95:14:45	Andreas now has a successful compile. The tests are crap, but
		appear to ( sort of ) work.

29/08/95:23:18	Converted driver across to new DBI format. It now appears
		to compile, install and run fairly reasonably. There are
		some serious messes that need cleared up in it, but it's
		fundamentally OK, I hope. Announced for pl0 testing.

04/09/95:15:04	Started back on getting the 0.60pl0 out. Tidied up the parsing
   		of statements for INSERT, CREATE &c statements. It just takes
		the first word of the statement now.

04/09/95:15:19	Looks OK. Tested against DBI 0.63 and looks reasonable.
		Announced release of 0.60pl1 and put up for ftp.

20/09/95:15:20	Patched a load of stuff including NULLs, and local device
		handling ( SV ). Released pl4, which was bogus. Released
		pl5 which should fix those issues.

20/09/95:22:17	Fixed overhang of old DBI bug with DBIc_ENDING remaining in
		DESTROY in mSQL.xs. Spotted by Marti Rijken and fixed.
		( Hopefully! )

18/10/95:15:13	Added in the missing API chunks for ListTables, ListDBs
		and ListFields.

		ListFields isnae working, but I'll fix that sometime soon....

05/11/95:11:32	Fixed $sth->readblob to return undef. Fixed Makefile.PL, 
		dbdimp.h, mSQL.h, dbdimp.c for release of 0.60pl7. Also tested
		'make test' which now works!

23/11/95:19:22	Fixed ListFields from the pointers given to me by Sven V.

24/11/95:03:13	Fixed error handling in all the func methods

24/11/95:13:01	Added 'NumRows' method to statement handles to return the
		number of rows returned ( or affected ) by a statement.o

		pre-release distributed to ANDK

25/11/95:09:20	Real release released! No major problems reported.

30/12/95:18:10	Altered mSQL.pm to allow for hostname:port style connections
		to known remote port machines. Sets ENV var since the
		msqlConnect API call doesn't support port arguments.

30/12/95:18:15	Added 'length' key into the hash returned by ListFields, so
		we can get the scale of the field.

24/03/96:22:34	Fixed bugs and upgraded versioning for perl5.002 to work
		properly. Released as pl10

-> Lamentable lack of ChangeLog information here!

27/03/97: Tidied up things with regard to 0.61 release. 

28/03/97: Patched NULL as undef bug
